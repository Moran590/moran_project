# moran_project
this is a project in statistical learning course!
## Introduction
The data is a collection of 25 time-aligned orthographic transcriptions and stutter classification
labels for 6 stutter types derived from the original UCLASS Release One dataset conversation. It
was created for the classification of stuttered speech. Each annotation CSV file contains information
pertaining to the corresponding WAV file of the same name (except one file that has no match with
any audio file), provided in the UCLASS Release One dataset.
Each row in each annotation file pertains to a single word or sound utterance, and its corresponding
timing and labels. The information for each row is as follows. Individual stutter types have been
labelled manually.
## motivation
The motivation and purpose of the research is to examine the relationship between word/sentence
length and the presence or absence of stuttering. Later, I will explore the audio files according to
the research questions and draw conclusions based on the frequencies observed.
## Abstract
This project investigates the classification of stuttered speech using Mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs) and a Random Forest classifier. The dataset comprises time-aligned orthographic
transcriptions and stutter classification labels for various stutter types. We explore the
relationship between word/sentence length and stuttering presence. Post addressing overfitting,
the Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of 99.34.
