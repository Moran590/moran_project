this is a project in statistical learning course!
## Introduction
The data is a collection of 25 time-aligned orthographic transcriptions and stutter classification
labels for 6 stutter types derived from the original UCLASS Release One dataset conversation. It
was created for the classification of stuttered speech. Each annotation CSV file contains information
pertaining to the corresponding WAV file of the same name (except one file that has no match with
any audio file), provided in the UCLASS Release One dataset.
Each row in each annotation file pertains to a single word or sound utterance, and its corresponding
timing and labels. The information for each row is as follows. Individual stutter types have been
labelled manually.
